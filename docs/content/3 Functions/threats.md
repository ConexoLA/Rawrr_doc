RAWRR uses the Risks-Vulnerabilities-Recommendations framework and therefore threat and risk management is one of the first logical steps. Each threat can be assigned a level of impact on the organization's work as well as a level of the probability of occurrence. The basic features of RAWRR related to threats are:

## View list of threats

If you have started RAWRR by importing a file or loading the test values, it is convenient that you can carefully review the preloaded information before creating or editing any item. To see the full list of threats you can click on "All" in the lower right next to the phrase "Rows per page". You can also select to view five (5), ten (10), or fifteen (15) items per page.

You can also delete multiple threats by selecting them in the left box and then clicking **"Delete Threats"**.

## Risk matrix

At the top in the middle you will find the **"Risk Matrix"** button. You can click at any time during the loading of the threats, or at the end of their identification, to see the graph that identifies each threat with a number and positions it on the graph according to its impact and probability to build the risk matrix of the organization you are evaluating.

To see the full name of a threat (and the rest of the associated data), you can hover your cursor over the number that identifies the threat.
